    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Christopher Fernandez, a sophomore at the University of South Florida majoring in Computer Science. My passion for the field began in high school when I decided to take Foundations of Programming and Foundations of Robotics, which sparked my interest in technology and problem-solving.

        <br><br>I have always had a love for astronomy and the crafts we send into space, which inspired me to join the Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry (SOAR). Through SOAR, I’m participating in the NASA Student Launch (NSL), combining my interest in technology with my passion for exploring the universe.
        
        <br><br>Looking ahead, my goal after earning my bachelor’s degree is to pursue a master’s in Computer Science and eventually work for NASA, contributing to advancements in space exploration.
